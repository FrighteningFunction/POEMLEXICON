# Fun in the elevator

There once was a dorm elevator,  
Who loved to play jokes so much greater   
Than just going up and down,  
It liked to turn smiles into frown  

One day it trapped poor Joe inside,  
For days and days, he couldn't hide.  
He cried and begged to be set free   
But the elevator just chuckled with glee  

Another time, it made a bet   
That it could chop off poor Tim's hand,  
and yet It closed its doors so fast and tight   
That Tim was left with quite the fright 

The elevator laughed and laughed   
While poor Tim's hand hung by a thread.  
But in the end, it was just a joke   
And Tim's hand was still attached,   
no one was broke

So if you find yourself inside that lift ,  
And it starts to play a trick so swift,  
Just remember, it's all in fun  
And the elevator just wants to have some!
