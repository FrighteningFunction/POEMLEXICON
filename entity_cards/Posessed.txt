The Posessed is a controverial character: it does not want too much bad,
yet it cannot cope with its morbid needs. It is obsessed with trains, so it boards them over and over:
especially at night. He is always the last passenger on every ride, the last to abort the train.
It likes to secretly harrass passengers: some say, it even likes to consume their brains.
When abort from trains it roams stations, chewing and cutting wires, sabotaging the railway system.

For a hobby, in his free time he loves to roam the Luther Otthon as well: roaming the halls, lighting up the night with his phone.

Past:
From accident, he one day, during an innocent play he shocked his roommate, Poor Joe with a phone charger.
It wasn't intentional. This changed the Posessed's life and turned him into a miserable person roaming the trains, metros
to escape his guilt.
