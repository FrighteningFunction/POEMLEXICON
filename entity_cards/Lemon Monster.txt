Name: Lemon Monster
Age: undefined
Status: overlord
Appearance: a huge, levitating lemon taking up the whole corridor's width, weighting about a ton. It has a single
cyclops eye. It is menasing and scary.
Description:
This is the top of the evolution, the most terrifying creature in the dormitory. It resides on the roof and roams the
dormitory for mischevious students between 2 and 3 am. During this time, the Lemon Monster probes through all the floors
from instinct, and if it gets disturbed, it attacks students. In the end, by 3 AM, by using the elevators, it goes back to the roof.
When in need, it uses the "főbértoilet" present at 4th floor during its visit in the dorm, and attacks anyone in there.

Attack: with lemon acid.
Its hearing is extraordinary.
It can be kept at bay (but just might), if people read "obligatory student programs" for it.
