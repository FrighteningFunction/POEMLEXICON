Description:
A malevolent person that loves order over all and cleaniness. It keeps the floor 2 of the dormitory in terror
in order to have everything nice and in place. Nobody dares question his rule. He is obsessed with the cleaniness
of the kitchen and punishes everyone who dares leave dust, dirt in it.
He washes his clothes every day.
He loves sponges.
He never leaves the presence of his wife (Wife of the Kitchen Monster), who also follows him everywhere.
He hates decorations because he thinks that breaks the plain look of the white walls of the level,
so whenever he sees a poster put out, he tears it apart in rage.
