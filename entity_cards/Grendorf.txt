Description and past:
Grendorf is a vain figure who one day was called upon to host a PBGYP program, which is "presbiter practise program",
where students came to do work for the temple. Most of the work involved cleaning the temple and the crypt below it.
The students who did not satisfy the needs, where locked into the dark crypt for days and days without anyone
suspecting him. There, they had to join the "bonesorting" work, where they had to sort bones by size and species.

He also built a bot that could sort bones effectively. He populated a part of the crypt with this prototype,
and these work without stopping.

He loves his food with screws and needles in it.
