In Budapest's surreal halls, a curious pair,
Tim and the Possessed, an unlikely, odd pair.
They'd wander the dorms, mysteries they'd seek,
In a world where the bizarre and strange would speak.

The Possessed, once eerie, now an enigma refined,
With a heart set on goodness, its intentions aligned.
They explored the trainyard, on an unusual quest,
For secrets hidden deep, they sought to manifest.

One peculiar day, as they chatted by the tracks,
A mystical aura, a web of fate, they'd attract.
A phone charger dangled, a bizarre contraption,
In the midst of their talk, a chain reaction.

An accident, indeed, as wires did conspire,
Electricity danced, setting souls on fire.
The Possessed, in its quest for the mystic sublime,
Had inadvertently altered the course of time.

Poor Tim, in this bizarre twist of their fate,
Found himself changed, in a surreal state.
By the trainyard's edge, his essence unfurled,
A fusion of beings, a surreal new world.

Tim and the Possessed, now forever combined,
In Budapest's mystique, their spirits entwined.
They embraced the surreal, in a friendship so vast,
In the realm of the bizarre, their adventures would last.
