In Budapestâ€™s bustling heart they stood,
Two students, intentions good.
To spare some time, they thought they knew,
Where Luther Otthon's speech was due.

Through tangled streets and traffic dense,
Past trams and cars, and high-fence,
To a hall they went, with hopes so high,
Little did they know, it was awry.

Melancthon's name upon the door,
Not what they were searching for,
But as time had slipped away,
To leave now would mean more dismay.

In they sat, with hopes so dim,
As an old woman began on a whim,
Her voice monotonous, her tales so long,
The presentation felt so wrong.

Two and a half hours they'd endure,
Seeking exits, they weren't sure.
With every slide, their patience wore thin,
Each minute felt like a steeping bin.

The night outside grew dark and cold,
Inside, the tales of old,
Two students trapped, their spirits low,
In the presentation they didn't want to know.
