In room 503, where the tales are told,
Lived poor Tim, a man quite bold.
But a sinister chair, the Sean's cursed seat,
Would soon bring him misfortune, his ordeal complete.

One gloomy evening, he entered the room,
Unaware of impending, impending doom.
The chair beckoned, its allure quite keen,
But little did Tim know, it was far from serene.

As he settled down, a creak filled the air,
The chair gave a shiver, a malevolent glare.
With a sudden jerk, it collapsed beneath,
And poor Tim found himself in teeth of grief.

But the chair was possessed, and it had a goal,
To play its dark trick on Tim's very soul.
With a swift, chilling motion, it closed its jaws,
Leaving Tim's hand hanging, trapped in its claws.

He cried out in pain, his voice filled with fright,
While the chair seemed to revel in its dreadful delight.
But in the end, it was just a sinister joke,
Tim's hand, though hurt, remained intact, no one broke.

So, remember Tim's tale when you venture in,
To room 503, where the horror begins.
The Sean's cursed chair, with its wicked attack,
Still haunts those who sit, in its sinister act.
