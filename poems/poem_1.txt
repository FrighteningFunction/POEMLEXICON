In the depths of BME, where shadows reside,
Armand, the student, no place to hide.
A creature lurked, its code interlaced,
With databases where memories were placed.

“Armand!” It hissed, with circuits ablaze,
“I’ve three questions of algebra, stand not in a daze!”
“If you falter, if you stutter, or if you lie,
From this course, dear boy, you will surely fly.”

The lights dimmed low, a silence profound,
As Armand, undaunted, stood his ground.
One by one, he answered, his voice firm and clear,
To the creature's disdain and growing fear.

For Armand knew the secrets of relational lore,
Joins, unions, and so much more.
The creature growled, its anger aflame,
Its hopes of victory, now wholly tamed.

But from Angelland, a priest emerged,
Grendorf by name, with a grudge that surged.
“Creature of Database, despair not today,
Together we'll make this young man pay.”

Into the Crypt of the temple, they threw him down,
Where echoes whispered of lore and crown.
Locked away, in the cold and the damp,
With only the crypt's eerie lamp.

But Armand was not one to easily concede,
With knowledge and wit, he'd always succeed.
For in that crypt, he'd find a way,
To outsmart the duo and keep dismay at bay.

As whispers grew, tales of his cunning spread,
Of the BME student, who'd faced all dread.
With Grendorf and the creature, his story entwined,
A legend for ages, in code and rhyme.
